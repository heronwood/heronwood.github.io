At 7P the meeting was called to order.

The Board recapped items that were completed in 2018, as follows:

* Completed landscaping of the center strip along Briarwood Lane and the East and West Signs.
* Repaired and landscaped the path leading to the pond area.
* The HOA assisted with the clean up of Briarwood Lane by contacting the City following the 2019 snowstorm.
* The HOA provided haul off service for snowstorm debris for the community.
* The HOA awarded Howard and Wendy Cushner with the first Gold Yard of the Month award. David and Linda Piddik received the Silver Yard in 2018

### Treasure’s Report

Current balance in the treasury as of May 8, 2019 was $8,318.78.

The Treasurer reported that two homeowners had not paid their HOA fees, which were due in January 2019. Two homeowners had also not yet paid their portion of the charges from last year’s backflow inspection/testing. The HOA provides community backflow testing through a negotiated contract with the BAT Lady and invoices those homeowners who require this mandatory service accordingly. Payments for this service are due upon receipt of the invoice from the HOA.

### New Business

1. Those present agreed that the community should take responsibility for general maintenance and clean up of the strip that runs along Briarwood Lane and around the two community signs. This would include general weeding and minor clean up throughout the year, with a more substantial clean up as a community effort in October and May to clean up debris from seasonal changes. Dates for this activity will be announced.
2. There was discussion on planting some sort of ground cover along the strip in the coming years as the bark begins to break down over time. The Board will investigate various plant type solutions and report back to the community.
3. General maintenance around the pond is needed to clear out the overgrowth of blackberries. The Board will look into hiring this task out or the possibility of using goats for hire to complete this task.
4. Backflow assembly testing was completed for those who have sprinkler systems. One home had not yet been tested because access to the system was behind a locked gate. Testing was contracted out to the BAT Lady and paid for by the HOA. Invoices will be sent to homeowners as applicable.
5. There was general discussion regarding ownership of the common area around the pond and along the greenbelt. Tax documents appear to indicate that each homeowner owns a portion of these areas through each homeowner’s tax assessment; however, the Board would like to have an attorney review tax documents to confirm ownership. This issue came to light while investigating homeowner’s requests to improve pond drainage and who should take responsibility for this maintenance. The Board will look into hiring an attorney to do this review as well as update the CCRs with recent changes made in the past, that include an increase in the HOA annual dues and a ban on using fireworks in the community.
6. Yard of the Month Gold Award will be issued to Guy and Martha Johnson for this month. The Silver award will go to Cindy and David Maywalt.
7. The Board will look at picnic table options to replace the broken table.
8. The Heronwood Community Picnic was scheduled for June 22, 2019 from 12P-3P. Details to follow.

### Election of Officers

Elections for new board members were offered. Current board members agreed to remain in lieu of no other volunteers coming forward, with the exception of Howard Cushner volunteering and unanimously nominated to replace Steve Murphy as outgoing Architectural Committee Chair. Thank you to Steve for all of his dedication and hard work in support of the HOA and the Board members over these past years!

Meeting adjourned.

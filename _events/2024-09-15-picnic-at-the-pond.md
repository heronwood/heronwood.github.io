We hope you’ll join us for a Heronwood HOA picnic on Sunday, Sept. 15 from 12-3 pm. This is a chance to meet your neighbors, get together, play lawn games and enjoy our little community.

The event will be held on the HOA-owned grass area abutting the pond at the bottom of the cul-de-sac of 36th Avenue.

Please plan to bring a main dish for your household and a side dish to share with the group. In previous years neighbors have volunteered a grill to be used by everyone to cook burgers and hot dogs. If someone (or multiple someones) is willing to bring their grill again this year, please let us know by signing up at the link below.

To get a headcount and not double up on side dishes, please RSVP for your household and use the comments section to list what you plan to bring. There’s also a spot to sign up to bring lawn games for everyone to play.

Sign up here: https://www.signupgenius.com/go/60B084FABAF2BAAFA7-51012710-heronwood

If you have any difficulty signing up, or have questions please email the board at board@heronwood.org.

We look forward to seeing everyone on Sept. 15!

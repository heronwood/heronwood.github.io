## Minutes

Meeting was called to order at 7PM. Two homeowners and the Board Members were present.

Tom Gonzalez presented the financial report (attached). It was noted that three (3) homeowners had not yet paid their annual HOA fee to date. Registered letters will be sent to them ASAP.

### Old Business:

* The landscaping bark project has been completed along Briarwood Lane, including around the two neighborhood signs.
* The path leading into the pond on 36th Avenue has been re-graveled.
* A section along the pond has been cleared to allow better access.
* With the changeover of the neighborhood water authority to Thurston County PUD, those homeowners who have sprinkler systems are now required to complete their own back flow test each year. This was originally taken care of through the old water company. The HOA negotiated neighborhood group pricing back flow testing with BAT Lady, a locally owned back flow testing group. The tests were completed in April. HOA will pay for the group tests and invoice $30 for those homeowners where tests were completed. BAT Lady will do annual tests on those homes. The $30 fee will be added to the HOA annual dues beginning with the next billing cycle for those homes that are tested.

### New Business:

* The Board is looking at options to replace the picnic tables at the pond.
* The hourly wage for lawn services will be increased from $25 to $30.
* Additional boarder rocks will be added to the path leading to the pond to help protect the gravel that was recently added.
* The Board will contact the landscape company that cleared the pond area for a bid to clear an additional 50 feet along the pond.
* The Board would like to solicit feedback from the homeowners for a community yard sale.
* The Board would like to start a Yard of the Month program to recognize homeowners for their hard work in taking care of their property. The HOA Board will select the yard of the month and present a sign to be posted for the recognition. The Board is looking into the type of sign to be displayed.

The election of new Board Members was tabled because of low turn out. The existing officers will remain in their positions for the next year.

The meeting adjourned at 730PM.

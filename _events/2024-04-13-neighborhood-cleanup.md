We welcome assistance from all who are able - even if it’s just for an hour. Please plan to bring your yard tools (rakes, loppers, pruners, etc.), wear thick/sturdy gloves to protect your hands and bring yard waste bins to handle the vegetation. 

**RSVP:** Please email the board at board@heronwood.org if you will join us. We’ll follow up with another email closer to with more details.

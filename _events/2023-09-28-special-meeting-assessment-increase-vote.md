Property owners: Jim Hagman, Howard Cushman, Jay Becker, Scott Post, Lowell Klaver.

Called to order: 7:30 p.m.

Jordan Moore stated the purpose of the special meeting was to hold a vote of the HOA membership on a proposed annual assessment increase. He also explained the required vote threshold per the HOA CC&Rs.

Howard offered background on why the proposed increase was requested, citing the need for landscape services to maintain the open areas.

A verbal vote was held, followed by the counting of votes mailed in via a paper ballot that was mailed to all households. Under the CC&Rs, owners can cast a vote in person or by proxy. In addition to the mailed in ballots people voted by proxy via a phone call, text message and email. 

Total 38 votes were cast, reaching the required â…” threshold for a quorum, per the HOA CC&Rs. The breakdown was 31 in favor, 7 opposed. This equates to a 81.5% passing rate, which meets the 75% threshold required by the CC&Rs.

Next steps: An email will be sent to membership announcing the vote total. Dues will be sent out in December. The next board meeting is Nov. 9, 2023 via Zoom.

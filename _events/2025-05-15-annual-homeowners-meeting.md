## Minutes

Attendance: President Jordan Moore, Secretary Brynn Graham, Treasurer Erin Floersch.

Owners: Mitch Blakney, Harrison Stankey, Wes Friedman, Susan & Joell Mott, Shaun Floersch

Meeting called to order at 7:05 p.m.

### Treasurer’s Report

Jordan reviewed the Treasurer’s Report because Erin was running late.

The HOA balance started the year with $12,231.70. After collecting outstanding dues, paying for annual expenses like landscaping costs, insurance, secretary of state filing, PO Box rental, and the pass-through money to the BAT Lady LLC for backflow testing, the end balance is $14,909.87.

A new expense added to the budget is the cost for a Google Workspace account for HOA materials. This includes file saving on the cloud for meeting minutes, budgets, and other board materials. It also includes the board email. Previously Jordan paid $3/month for a similar service out of his own pocket, but the cost went up. The board agreed to move to the Google Suite. This will also ensure a smoother transition between board members when new people are elected. 

### Landscape Survey Review

At the end of 2024 the board sent out a survey electronically and mailed to every property owner a hard copy with the annual dues assessments to gather owner responses on how people want to see the open space/HOA owned areas maintained going forward.

48 responses were received of the total 57 properties. All survey responses will be shared online once they are made anonymous and any identifying information is removed. The board will send an email once the surveys are online so people can read through them if they want.

Jordan reviewed each question and the percentages for each response. Responses are summarized below (Note: the questions and answers summarized below are not the exact language used in the survey):

Should the HOA develop the perimeter trail system that is identified on the plat map?
* 50.88% want to leave it as it currently is, undeveloped.
* 15.79% want to see it developed if the HOA incurs no additional costs.
* 17.54% want to see it developed even if that means the HOA incurs additional costs.
* 15.79% did not respond.

Should the HOA remove vegetation and landscape the pond slope?
* 22.81% want to leave it as is with.
* 40.35% want to see it maintained with no additional cost to the HOA.
* 19.30% want to see it maintained even if there is additional cost.
* 17.54% did not respond.

Should the HOA perform additional maintenance on 38th Street?
* 10.53% want to see it left as is.
* 14.04% want to see the currently cleared area maintained.
* 36.84% want to continue clearing brush and invasive species with no additional cost to the HOA.
* 21.05% want to continue clearing brush and invasive species if there is additional cost.
* 17.54% did not respond.

Jordan summarized the responses saying the question about the perimeter trails had the most clear opinion about how the neighborhood wants to proceed. This one is also the one that resulted in the most feedback from owners who felt strongly about the space.

It was agreed based on the responses, the majority of respondents don’t seem interested in developing the perimeter trail and want to keep it as it is now. Feedback included concerns about privacy and security if the perimeter trails were to be cleared and used for walking. 

Jordan shared he is inclined to leave the trails as-is because the majority of the owners said to leave them alone. Brynn agreed, sharing she felt the majority of owners made it clear they wanted it left alone.

Discussion about the slope leading to the pond ensued.

Owner Mitch Blakney said he contacted the city planning department on May 15, 2025 and they were clear the HOA shouldn’t clear any vegetation from Briarwood Lane where the open space is located, or 38th. He was told we can clear noxious weeds but not invasive species. The same goes with the slope along the pond. He requested an email with this information to share with the HOA board. The City of Gig Harbor said it would email a response on Monday, May 19, 2025. Mitch will share the email once he receives it. The board will post the email to the website and email all owners once it’s online so people can read it.

Owner Susan Mott shared the City of Gig Harbor recently clear cut all of the invasive plants along 38th from the sidewalk to their "Sensitive Area" signs. She said it is interesting they now say vegetation can’t be cut.

Brynn shared it could be that the city issued a permit for the sidewalk construction that allowed for the plants to be cleared to install the project. Once cleared the contractor replanted the area.

Susan asked when there would be board elections. Jordan shared the CC&Rs say the terms are 2 years and the board held elections at its May 2024 meeting. The next elections will be in May 2026.

Meeting adjourned 7:36 p.m.

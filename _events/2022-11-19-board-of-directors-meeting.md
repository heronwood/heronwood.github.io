## Agenda

A review of the HOA finances shows that the current annual due amount has not kept pace with inflation over the years. At the meeting, a Treasurer’s report will highlight financial projections and the board will review options for how to proceed. This could include voting on an increase to our annual HOA dues. Under the HOA bylaws the board can implement a 5% increase without a vote of the membership. Anything above 5% must gain approval from the total membership.

The board encourages members to attend to hear this discussion and participate in the conversation.

Additional items to be reviewed at the meeting include:
* A status update on the board’s request to remove the redundant street light at 38th Street and Briarwood Lane.
* A proposal to increase the frequency of HOA board meetings to one per quarter.
* A report from the landscaping committee about maintaining the HOA common areas and introduction of proposal to address on-going maintenance needs and potentially increase maintenance beyond the current level.
* Setting a schedule for community work parties to maintain open areas.

We hope you will join us in person, Saturday, Nov. 19 at 1 p.m. at the Gig Harbor Library, 4424 Point Fosdick Drive NW.
